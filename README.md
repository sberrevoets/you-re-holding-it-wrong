# You're Holding It Wrong

An iMessage sticker pack for when "you're holding it wrong" comes to mind. To add more images, simply drag an image into Stickers.xcstickers and done!

## Installation

To install, open the project, check "Automatically manage signing" for both targets and run it on your device. That's it! A few things to note:

- In our initial testing, images would only show up if you have a paid developer account. If you don't, the app will build fine and there is no indication that it's not working. This is probably a bug (&lt;insert radar once filed&gt;).
- When you add your own images, note that in beta 1 you can't drag JPG images onto text message bubbles (&lt;insert radar once filed&gt;). Also check out the [Messages reference](https://developer.apple.com/reference/messages) for some file size/dimension limitations (which in our testing weren't enforced yet).
- People with iOS 10/macOS Sierra installed will see stickers but will need to build this app to their own device to be able to use them theirselves.
